## Project Description
### The purpose of this memory game is to memorize the locations of the cards in the game and to make pairs of cards by turning them. The cards are displayed in a 4×4 grid and they are shuffled before the game begins. When the 2 cards match, it’s a pair! You win the pair and have the right to make another pair, otherwise, the cards are automatically turned face down. The objective of the game is to make 8 pairs of matching cards.
